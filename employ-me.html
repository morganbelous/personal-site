        <h2 class="title-underline">The Idea</h2>
        <p>
          Cornell's college campus is brimming with talent. However, it’s often
          a challenge to reach a large audience of students quickly and easily.
          Other than the Cornell meme Facebook group, individual clubs, and
          other campus groups, it can seem impossible to bring the community
          together. I wanted to create a freelance marketplace that allows
          students to post their talents and services for others to take
          advantage of. On the flip side, if someone were ever in need of a
          tutor for an upcoming prelim, a photographer to snap a new fancy
          headshot, or even a software engineer to make the next best social
          network come to life, they could use Employ Me to fulfill their needs
          and support their peers at same time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title-underline">The Story</h2>
        <p>
          I started this project in November of 2019. Unfortunately, it was kind
          of pushed to the back burner as school picked up for the spring
          semester. However, once I got home for
          <span class="project-em">coronacation~,</span>
          I wanted to take advantage of my newfound free time. Within the first
          few days of coming home, I spent hours setting up the server,
          deploying it to Heroku, and connecting it to the frontend. I think
          that finally being able to retrieve data from the server was one of my
          proudest accomplishments of the whole project. Since then, I have
          added so much more to the app. In addition to creating my own server,
          I did a complete redesign, learned all about networking, integrated
          Google Sign in, experimented with tab view controllers, and more.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title-underline">Challenges Faced</h2>

        <h3>Google Sign In and Navigation</h3>
        <p>
          This project was my first time experimenting with Google Sign, and it
          was definitely no walk in the park. Setting up the sign in page part
          wasn’t too bad, thanks to the super helpful documentation that Google
          provides. However, the main challenge was integrating the sign in view
          controller with the other controllers. Ultimately, I decided to set
          the root view controller to a UINavigationController and then present
          the sign in view controller modally. This way, the sign in page is
          only presented if the user is not signed in.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating the Backend</h3>
        <p>
          At school, I was lucky enough to take a backend development course,
          where I learned how to create a Python Flask app using SQL and
          SQLAlchemy. I learned how to run localhost and test routes using
          Postman. However, deployment was a completely new challenge. I did
          some research, and decided that Heroku would be the best choice for
          me. It seemed pretty popular (and more importantly, free). Connecting
          Heroku to the git repository, setting up the environment, and adding
          all required files <del>almost made me pull my hair out</del> was
          definitely super easy and no problem at all. Always up for a
          challenge, though, and reaching this milestone was definitely one of
          my most proud accomplishments for this project!
        </p>

        <h3>Base 64 Image Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          I needed to figure out a way to deal with the job images. Originally,
          I had images in the assets folder, and was just storing the names of
          the images in the database. However, I knew that this wasn't scalable.
          I considered using Google Firebase to store the images, but ultimately
          decided to use base 64 encoding. It seemed easy enough: convert an
          image to a string, store the string, and then fetch the string and
          decode it to use in the collection view cells. It was a challenge
          trying to figure out what the base 64 strings of the original images
          were, because they were too long to print out. I then tried to use an
          online encoder, but it was giving me the wrong strings, resulting in a
          bunch of fatal errors because they couldn't be decoded properly.
          Finally, I decided to use breakpoints to hover over the variables and
          copy the base 64 strings, which I then pasted into the SQLite
          database. Yay! I know that this might not be the best solution to my
          problem, however, I think that it works perfectly fine for the size
          and purpose of my app. If I ever were to actually release my app for
          the public, learning more about data storage and considering privacy,
          security and space concerns would be really interesting!
        </p>

        <h2 class="title-underline">Lessons Learned</h2>
        <h3>Viritual Environments</h3>
        <p>
          Previously, I didn’t think that virtual environments were worth my
          time. I didn’t see the need for them and they just seemed like a pain
          to navigate. Naively, I would just download Python packages straight
          to my computer. Honey, did I have a big storm coming. Creating a
          requirements.txt file for deployment with only the necessary
          dependencies was <span class="project-em">virtually</span> (haha,
          punny) impossible with all of the dozens of packages I had installed.
          Using a virtual environment made everything so much easier to work
          with!
        </p>
        <h3>Never Giving Up</h3>
        <p>
          When I started making this app in November, I could never have
          imagined what it turned into. So many hours of watching YouTube
          tutorials, learning new things, debugging, and just staring at the
          computer screen hopelessly went into this project. There were so many
          times that I thought about giving up. But, with every challenge that I
          faced, the feeling of finding a solution just got more and more
          exhilarating. I am so proud of what I have created, and it just goes
          to show that I can do anything that I put my mind to. I can’t wait to
          see what the future holds!
        </p>

        <h2 class="title-underline">What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
          If I were to continue developing this app, I have a lot of ideas.
          Firstly, I would create a system where users could leave reviews on
          certain postings, so that future users could gain some more insight on
          a potential hire. Secondly, I would integrate Google Firebase Chat to
          allow for communication directly inside the app. Lastly, I would
          incorporate some kind of payment platform, such as Venmo, which would
          allow all transactions to occur within the app, too.
